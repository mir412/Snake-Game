# Snake-Game
This is a classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. The goal is to score as many points as possible by eating food without causing the snake to crash, with the game ending if the snake hits a boundary or itself.
